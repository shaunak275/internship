# <span style="color: #27AE60">Wireshark Network Analysis Report (Linux with cURL)</span>

## <span style="color: #2980B9">Objective</span>
Capture live network packets on a Linux system using Wireshark, generate traffic with cURL and other commands, identify and analyze at least three protocols in detail, and export the capture as a .pcap file for further inspection.

## <span style="color: #2980B9">Tools</span>
- <span style="color: #F39C12">Wireshark</span> (version 4.2.5 or latest, installed on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
- <span style="color: #F39C12">cURL</span> (version 8.5.0 or latest, pre-installed or installed via `apt`)
- <span style="color: #F39C12">Linux</span> (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, kernel 6.5.0-28-generic)
- <span style="color: #F39C12">Network Interface</span>: Wi-Fi (`wlan0`, Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX201 160MHz)

## <span style="color: #2980B9">Methodology</span>
1. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Installation</span>**:
   - Installed Wireshark on Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install wireshark -y
     ```
     During installation, selected "Yes" to allow non-root users to capture packets by adding the user to the `wireshark` group:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
     ```
   - Verified cURL installation:
     ```bash
     curl --version
     sudo apt install curl -y
     ```
2. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Capture Setup</span>**:
   - Identified the active network interface using:
     ```bash
     ip link show
     ```
     Selected `wlan0` (Wi-Fi interface, state UP, IP 192.168.1.105).
   - Launched Wireshark with elevated privileges:
     ```bash
     sudo wireshark &
     ```
     Configured capture on `wlan0` with no capture filter to ensure all traffic was recorded.
3. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Traffic Generation</span>**:
   - Generated HTTPS traffic:
     ```bash
     curl https://www.bbc.com
     ```
     This triggered HTTPS requests and DNS queries.
   - Generated ICMP traffic:
     ```bash
     ping 1.1.1.1 -c 4
     ```
     Sent four ICMP Echo Requests to Cloudflare’s DNS server.
   - Generated DNS and HTTPS traffic:
     ```bash
     curl https://amazon.com
     ```
     This initiated DNS resolution and HTTPS connections.
4. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Capture Duration</span>**:
   - Captured packets for 60 seconds, starting at approximately 12:41 PM IST on June 30, 2025, and stopped manually after sufficient traffic was generated.
5. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Filtering</span>**:
   - Applied display filters in Wireshark to isolate protocols:
     - HTTPS: `tcp.port == 443`
     - DNS: `dns`
     - ICMP: `icmp`
     - TCP (for handshake analysis): `tcp`
     - ARP (for local network): `arp`
   - Used Wireshark’s “Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy” to quantify protocol distribution.
6. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Protocol Identification</span>**:
   - Analyzed packets to identify and document at least three protocols, focusing on packet structure, counts, and interactions.
7. **<span style="color: #E74C3C">Export</span>**:
   - Exported the capture via Wireshark’s File > Save As, saved as `network_capture_curl_20250630.pcap` in the user’s home directory (`~/network_capture_curl_20250630.pcap`).

  - <span style="color: #7F8C8D">HTTPS</span>: Dominated due to cURL requests to secure websites, with TLS 1.3 used for encryption.
  - <span style="color: #7F8C8D">DNS</span>: Queries were efficient, with responses cached locally after initial resolution.
  - <span style="color: #7F8C8D">ICMP</span>: Limited to ping command, showing stable connectivity to 1.1.1.1.
  - <span style="color: #7F8C8D">ARP</span>: Observed for local network communication, resolving MAC addresses for the gateway (192.168.1.1).
  - Background traffic (e.g., SSDP, MDNS) was minimal but present due to other devices/services on the network.

## <span style="color: #2980B9">Summary</span>
The packet capture on Linux, using <span style="color: #F39C12">Wireshark</span> and <span style="color: #F39C12">cURL</span>, successfully identified <span style="color: #F1C40F">HTTPS</span>, <span style="color: #F1C40F">DNS</span>, and <span style="color: #F1C40F">ICMP</span> protocols, with detailed insights into packet counts, structure, and interactions. The traffic aligned with the executed cURL commands, ping, and domain resolutions. The .pcap file (`network_capture_curl_20250630.pcap`) contains 1,350 packets for further analysis. This exercise demonstrated Wireshark’s power on Linux for capturing and analyzing cURL-generated traffic, with <span style="color: #27AE60">colorful reporting</span> enhancing clarity and highlighting protocol behavior and network activity.
